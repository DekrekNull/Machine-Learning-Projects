# Instructions
# A) Construct the profile of each movie: at least using ratings *Other info optional (e.g. genres, tags).
# B) Copmute similarity score for all movie-movie pairs using centered cosine.
# C) Compute the neighborhood set N for each movie. Size of 5 highest similarity score movies, ties broken by lexicographic ordering of movieId.
# D) Estimate the ratings of other users who didn't rate each movie using the neighborhood set.
# E) Compute the recommended movies for each user. Top 5 with highest ratings, ties broken by lexicographic ordering.
# Output) Top 5 recommendations for each user.
#   Line format: "User-id1 movie-id1 movie-id2 movie-id3 movie-id4 movie-id5"
